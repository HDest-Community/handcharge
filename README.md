# HandCharge

[![Nightly Build](https://github.com/HDest-Community/handcharge/actions/workflows/nightly.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HDest-Community/handcharge/actions/workflows/nightly.yml)

_Original Author: Sonoda (a.k.a. Taichi Suzuki)_

This adds a hand-powered battery recharging item.  Load the battery, and hit alt-reload to start cranking!

Loadout Code: `chg`  
Can be configured with `pump` to use a simpler pump-crank, only requiring tapping fire instead of alternating fire & alt-fire to complete a crank cycle.

- Undead Zeratul, for porting into the community organization, updating Spawn Handlers & menus.
